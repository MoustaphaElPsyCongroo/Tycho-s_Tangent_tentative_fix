# Tycho's Tangent tentative fix

Partial fix of Caves of Qud's Tycho's Tangent for latest beta (probably works
on stable too but not tested.
On Moon Stair Alpha starts fine but new items/NPCs have no description and I assume no effect).

No more errors or crashes on startup and items/NPCs seem to work fine when
spawned with wishes. But I don't have enough World Map knowledge to replace the
Carbide City on the map.
