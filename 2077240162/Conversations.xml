			Hmmm, you might be of some aid. How's your aim? More importantly, is your will one of rust or iron?

			The towers, you see. We've since abandoned them, save for the lower levels. It's gotten especially violent these last few years, and without a functioning defence grid we are at the mercy of our blades.

			Esper cults, such as the Seekers of the Sightless Way, are ever-present; flesh-eating flora and beasts are a given.

			You'll need special access to reach the upper levels. I can sell you my card; the pay-off in treasure and loot will surely be worth it. Won't be cheap, though. Applying for a new one is always a pain, what with android bureaucracy and all.

			Overall, I'd say the androids are a little more privileged than the rest; they run the place, save for the shops. They refer to themselves as 'the collective'.

			His grave lays beneath the Reliquary. Though beware, and I repeat myself, beware; the underbelly is a hotpot of carnage and violence. We lost all control after the defence grid shut down. Rogue mechanites run amok, and show no signs of stopping.

			Oh, it's a bit tragic, really. We'd become a bit too different, Pyre and I. Just a little too different.

			Safe to say I don't think any of my crops beat the flames; we received the message loud and clear, and left on a trek for a new home.

			From Red Rock! Have you heard of the place? Probably not; it's mostly a landmark for the locals of the region.
			There's not much there, really. I don't miss it, especially after having lost my slice of Eden.

			Right! I require someone skilled in harvestry to find and bring both flower and seed to me.

			I dare not leave my home again, after what happened. And even here some of the locals eye us with suspicion, though Spyro says not to worry; according to him this place is home to free thinkers of all sorts.

			Apologies if I was a bit rude to you, earlier on. I haven't fully settled down here yet.

			As for your first task, let's start with something simple, and close. I'd like for you to bring me a bellflower!

			Their leaves are a sleek silver, and their petals glow a bright white. Under the moonlight they shine like little specks of light off a glass plane.

			Its entire survival strategy is reliant on blending in with its surroundings; the grey tones and fluorescent lights of skyscrapers.

			What makes the bellflower so rare is its habitat. Only in the chrome towers of Andromimos does it grow! Many times have I tried to port them to the red soil of the land, but to no use. The flower is simply too delicate and fragile.

			Now, we must pick a colour for the dress, and it is known that no colour matches that of the Fleur de Lys, or so I have heard.

			Years has it been since I've last seen one, and so my memory needs a little refreshing! Please, my apprentice, bring me a Fleur de Lys, from the many swamps of Qud.

			Your curiosity is admirable, florocrat!

			The Fleur de Lys grows not only in the marshlands, but also in the Jungle, and by River Svy.

			It is famed far and wide for its beautiful colour, as it sports a purple hue unlike any other in the land!

			A lesser known fact is that its seeds are tiny; no larger than a grain of sand. Fascinating, right?
