  "Description": "Tycho’s Tangent (TT) is a mod that aims to enrich your Qud experience through the addition of countless lore-friendly critters, items, NPCs, as well as a variety of starting backgrounds and other goodies. All TT content is designed to blend in seamlessly with pre-existing game assets. A new major location, the city of Andromimos, has also been added, and features a variety of NPCs, dungeons and quests, expanding your mid-to-late game options.\n\n[i]You trip and stumble on root-covered soil, the fall snapping you awake. What’s this? An oddly hued plant, boasting familiar yet foreign shapes. The blade by your side, too, is of unknown origins. All is as it should seem, and yet in your mind, not all is so. Perhaps you’ve tripped one time too many, one plane too deep, one timeline too far. Brace yourself, traveller, for this world is gleaming and full of terrors.[/i]\n\n\n\n[h1]Newest version: v1.5.2 - Azure Skies II update[/h1]\n\nRide into the sunset in [b]Andromimos[/b], an ancient city teeming with danger and ripe with opportunity. It is in many ways the dysfunctional heart of Qud, as strange folk from all four corners (*laughs in blind*) gather here, under the watchful gaze of the androids. Explore layer after layer, climbing the skies in chrome towers or digging deep in search of “Azure” in this beautifully handcrafted city.
